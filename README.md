# Engorgio: An Arbitrary-Precision Unbounded-Size Hybrid  Encrypted Database via Quantized Fully Homomorphic Encryption
This code is the implementation of the paper Engorgio: An Arbitrary-Precision Unbounded-Size Hybrid  Encrypted Database via Quantized Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

## Requirements

```
git 
gcc >= 10
cmake >= 3.16
GMP 6.2.0 
```

## Building Engorgio
You can build the Engorgio (out-of-source) for your machine by executing the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


Following the instructions above, output binaries will be generated in the `build/bin/` directory. You can run these binaries by:
```
$./bin/comparison_test
$./bin/sort_test
$./bin/sync_test
$./bin/topk_test
$./bin/relational_query_test
$./bin/vectorized_query_test_1
$./bin/vectorized_query_test_2
$./bin/hybrid_query_test_1
$./bin/hybrid_query_test_2
```

## Examples
### Homomorphic Comparison
- codes `test/comparison_test.cpp`  
- output binary `build/bin/comparison_test` 
- This demo shows the homomorphic comparison operator `ArbQuantComp` in Engorgio. Execute the binary file `comparison_test`, we will get the latencry of Engorgio in fig 5a and fig 5b. 

### Homomorphic Sorting
- codes `test/sort_test.cpp`  
- output binary `build/bin/sort_test` 
- This demo shows the homomorphic sorting operator `HomSort` in Engorgio. Execute the binary file `sort_test`, we will get the latencry of Engorgio in fig 5c. Although we have reduced the number of experiments, it still takes a long time (20+ hours) to complete the experiment.

### Homomorphic Synchronization
- codes `test/sync_test.cpp`  
- output binary `build/bin/sync_test` 
- This demo shows the homomorphic synchronization operator `HomSync` in Engorgio. Execute the binary file `sync_test`, we will get the latencry of Engorgio in fig 5d. 

### Homomorphic Top-k
- codes `test/topk_test.cpp`  
- output binary `build/bin/topk_test` 
- This demo shows the homomorphic Topk operator `HomTopK` in Engorgio. Execute the binary file `topk_test`, we will get the latencry of Engorgio in fig 5e. 

### Relational Query Evaluation
- codes `test/relational_query_test.cpp`  
- output binary `build/bin/relational_query_test` 
- This demo evaluates relational queries on an encrypted database with varying numbers of rows. Execute the binary file `relational_query_test`, we will get the latencry of Engorgio in fig 6a and fig 6b. 

### Vectorized Query Evaluation
- codes `test/vectorized_query_test_1.cpp` and `test/vectorized_query_test_2.cpp`
- output binary `build/bin/vectorized_query_test_1` and `build/bin/vectorized_query_test_2`
- This demo evaluates vectorized queries on an encrypted database with varying numbers of rows. Execute the binary files `vectorized_query_test_1` and `vectorized_query_test_2`, we will get the latencry of Engorgio in fig 6c and fig 6d. Although we have reduced the number of experiments, it still takes a long time (20+ hours) to complete the experiment.

### Hybrid Query Evaluation
- codes `test/hybrid_query_test_1.cpp` and `test/hybrid_query_test_2.cpp` 
- output binary `build/bin/hybrid_query_test_1` and `build/bin/hybrid_query_test_2`
- This demo evaluates hybrid queries on an encrypted database with varying numbers of rows. Execute the binary files `hybrid_query_test_1` and `hybrid_query_test_2`, we will get the latencry of Engorgio in fig 6e.  Although we have reduced the number of experiments, it still takes a long time (20+ hours) to complete the experiment.
